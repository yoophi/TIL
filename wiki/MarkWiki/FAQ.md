Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

Here are some frequently asked questions along with some (helpful?) answers.

### Why Isn't My Wiki Link Working?

Only certain characters are allowed in wiki links. If your link contains
characters that aren't allowed, then MarkWiki won't recognize it. Check out
the `Wiki Links` section on the [[MarkWiki/Features]] page.

### How Do I Make A Wiki Link To A Section?

If you want to make a wiki link directly to a section instead of a normal wiki
page, then you must add a forward slash at the end of the link like
[[MarkWiki/]].
